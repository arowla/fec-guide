Detailed files
========

The [detailed files](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml) include cycle-specific data for committees, candidates, individual contributions and committee transactions to candidates and between committees. Each cycle, beginning with 1979-80, has five files with data representing that cycle. The current cycle and its immediate 2-3 preceding cycles also have three smaller tables that represent additions, changes and deletions to the individual contributions file. The FEC changed the format of these files from fixed-width to pipe-delimited in 2012.
